    "This report summarizes the data assembled on the students of Py City Schools, both on the district and individual school level. It provides insights into how school budget, type, and size may influence academic performance. The trends it reveals will serve as a guide to inform decision making for the district education board.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most obvious trend is the difference in performance between charter and district schools. The overall passing rate of charter schools exceeds district schools by over 35%. The largest difference can be seen in math, with 27% more students passing in charter schools. \n",
    "\n",
    "Though district schools appear to be struggling more, students across all schools seem to be doing better in reading than math. Additional support may be needed in that subject both in the classroom and outside of it. \n",
    "\n",
    "One surprising aspect of this analysis is that there does not appear to be a correlation between school spending and performance. "
